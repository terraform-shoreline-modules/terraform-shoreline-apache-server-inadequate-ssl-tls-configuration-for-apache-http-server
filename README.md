### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Inadequate SSL/TLS Configuration for Apache HTTP Server.
---

This incident type refers to a security vulnerability in the SSL/TLS configuration of the Apache HTTP Server, which can leave the server and its users vulnerable to attacks. The SSL/TLS configuration is responsible for encrypting the communication between the server and its clients, and if it is not configured properly, it can be exploited by hackers to intercept or modify sensitive data. This type of incident requires immediate attention from software engineers to ensure that the SSL/TLS configuration is properly configured to prevent any potential security threats.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE="PLACEHOLDER"

export SERVER_ADDRESS="PLACEHOLDER"

export PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export CIPHER_LIST="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_ERROR_LOG="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check the Apache version
```shell
httpd -v
```

### Check the SSL/TLS configuration file
```shell
cat ${PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check the SSL/TLS certificate
```shell
openssl x509 -in ${PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE} -text -noout
```

### Check the SSL/TLS protocol versions enabled
```shell
openssl s_client -connect ${SERVER_ADDRESS}:${PORT} -tls1_2
```

### Check the SSL/TLS cipher suites enabled
```shell
openssl ciphers -v '${CIPHER_LIST}'
```

### Check the Apache error logs for SSL/TLS related errors
```shell
tail -f ${PATH_TO_ERROR_LOG}
```

## Repair

### The first step to remediate this incident type is to identify the specific SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities that exist in the Apache HTTP Server. This can be done by conducting a security audit of the server configuration and identifying any weaknesses or misconfigurations.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Conduct a security audit of the Apache HTTP Server configuration

audit_output=$(sudo apache2ctl configtest)



# Check if there are any SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities

if [[ "$audit_output" == *"Syntax OK"* ]]; then

    echo "No SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities found."

    exit 0

else

    echo "SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities found."

fi



# Fix the SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities

sudo sed -i 's/SSLCipherSuite.*/SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:AES256-SHA256:RC4:HIGH:!MD5:!aNULL:!EDH:!AESGCM/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf

sudo sed -i 's/SSLProtocol.*/SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3/g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf

sudo a2enmod ssl

sudo service apache2 restart



echo "SSL/TLS configuration vulnerabilities remediated."

exit 0
